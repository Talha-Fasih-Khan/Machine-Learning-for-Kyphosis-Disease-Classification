# Machine-Learning-for-Kyphosis-Disease-Classification

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project was to build a robust classification model using machine learning techniques to predict the presence or absence of kyphosis based on clinical and radiographic features. The goal was to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and determining appropriate treatment plans. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* etc.

## Project Description
* Dataset
  * The analysis utilized a dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with kyphosis. The dataset included clinical and radiographic features such as Age (in months), Number of vertebrae involved, Start vertebra, and the target variable Kyphosis (0 for absent, 1 for present).
* Methodology
  * Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed by performing a train-test split. Additionally, the features dataset (Age, Number, Start) was scaled to ensure proper model training.
* Models Considered
  * Three machine learning models were employed: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
  * Evaluation: The performance of the models was evaluated using classification reports and confusion matrices. The metrics assessed included precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
